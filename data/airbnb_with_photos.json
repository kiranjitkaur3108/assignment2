If you are tempted to walk out on the roof, please do so in your bare feet only.  There is no railing for the roof.  Under no circumstances may children access the roof.

If you're a musician, you're welcome to use my gear, and we can even lay down a jam! Please note: We have clicked \"Hot Tub\" as an amenity because what we have, a jacuzzi-stye therapeutic bath, comes very close. Typically, Hot Tubs are big, hold 6-8 people and are out on the deck somewhere. What we have is a tub that makes serious bubbles with both water and air jets, and comes with a built-in customized 4-head shower. This tub also happens to be extra deep, extra wide, and extra long.

Please remove your shoes indoors. Boston streets are pretty gross. Please do not bring your friends into the home. We are sure they're lovely people, but we don't know who they are! We are generally in bed by 10:30 pm on weeknights. You are absolutely welcome to come and go at any time of the night, just try to keep things quiet for the sake of everyone in the building.
